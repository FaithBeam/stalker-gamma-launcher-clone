## Usage

### Windows

1. Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/FaithBeam/stalker-gamma-launcher-clone/releases) page
2. Extract the zip in the same directory as the `.Grok's Modpack Installer` folder so `stalker-gamma-gui.exe` is next to `G.A.M.M.A. Launcher.exe`
3. Run `stalker-gamma-gui.exe`
4. First install initialization
5. Install / Update GAMMA (x2)
    - A working install takes two full installs. Idk why lol. 2nd install is faster though. 
7. Play
